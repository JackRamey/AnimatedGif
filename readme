AnimatedGif is an screensaver for Mac OSX / macOS that plays animated gif's. It also has an background mode to run the pictures as desktop background. 
I wrote it originally with Xcode 6.2 and SDK for OSX 10.9 Mavericks and test it under OSX 10.9 Mavericks and OSX 10.11 El Capitan. 
The latest release was compiled with Xcode 7.3.1 with SDK for OSX 10.11 El Capitan. I heard from a user that the program also runs under macOS 12 Sierra.
Anyway if you have any problems with newer versions of macOS feel free to give some feedback.
